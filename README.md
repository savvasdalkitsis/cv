# About Me

Android geek, TDD nut, international speaker, born in Greece, British citizen living in London for the past 12 years.

I'm obsessed with technology, and love everything Android. I have been coding as a pastime since the age of 7 and have been doing it professionally since 2008, focusing on Android for the last 13 years.

I have a B.Math from Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, Greece

# Experience

## ASOS, Principal Software Engineer

- Aug 2017 – Aug 2024
- London, UK
- The Apps team (iOS and Android) grew at a very fast pace, from 10 engineers to more than 30 in the span of 2 years, and someone was needed to take ownership of the team as a whole. In my new role as Principal Engineer , I moved away from the daily delivery of one agile team into having an overview of all 6 teams on both platforms. I was tasked with providing support and guidance when it came to code quality while also focusing on the bigger picture of how the teams deliver, making the developer experience as removed from distractions as possible. Notable work includes
- Helping bring the iOS team to the same level of automation as the Android team
- Moving all new development on the Android client to Kotlin, greatly reducing maintenance overhead and bugs. A talk about our transition was presented at [Mobiconf, Kraków](https://noti.st/savvas/3RYKMi)
- Helping our Principal Architect and Platform Leads plan the upcoming roadmaps by being involved during the research phase and helping estimate effort and feasibility of proposed features
- Deeply involved in helping shape our recruitment process, screening candidates before the in-depth technical interview
- Getting involved in the wider engineering community inside ASOS, something the Apps team had been very isolated from, and started adopting some of the tools & standards already in place for the other teams
- Building a new configuration web service for the apps, allowing us to easily and quickly configure our offering per region and market. The service is deployed using Docker and Microsoft's AKS
- Internally evangelizing the Apps team's testing methodology, with a few teams having already adopted our approach
- Being heavily involved in the reboot of the [ASOS technology blog](https://medium.com/asos-techblog)

## ASOS, Lead Software Engineer

- July 2016 – Aug 2017
- London
- Initially brought in to lead one of the 2 Android teams, I was responsible for 4 engineers, helping maintain coding standards and making sure the team could deliver in a timely manner while not sacrificing quality. During my time as a team lead
- I introduced a test first mentality, focusing on BDD and automated testing, which the project lacked completely
- Mentored junior and senior team members, especially with regards to test driven development
- Having achieved almost 100% acceptance testing automation, we managed to reduce our release cadence. from 1 month with a half day regression testing phase, down to a weekly release with a 10 minute smoke test. We have effectively achieved CD, only choosing a weekly release schedule so as to not swamp our users with updates
